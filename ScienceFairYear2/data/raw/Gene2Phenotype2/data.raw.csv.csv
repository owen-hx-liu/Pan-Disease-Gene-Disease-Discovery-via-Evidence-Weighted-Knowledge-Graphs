The KCNE1 protein (previous names LQT5, mink, IsK) functions as a regulatory subunit of KCNQ1. It has 7 annotated exons but only one is protein coding (PMID: 30461122). A small number of variants have been reported, mainly missense and inframe indels. In more recent studies, 4 nonsense variants have also been reported (PMID: 30461122; 31941373). However, in one of these studies (PMID: 30461122), patients were ascertained for deafness and QT prolongation is either variable or not reported in some family members. The authors did not carry out functional studies to determine the effect of these variants on mRNA but suggest that given there is only one coding exon, these nonsense variants would be unlikely to result in nonsense mediated decay.

Missense variants in PTPN11 are responsible for the majority of cases. Rare cases have been attributed to variants in RAF1, BRAF, and MAP2K1. There is no definite evidence of PTPN11 variants causing isolated cardiac disease without other features of NSML, but the syndromic phenotype can be subtle and may be underdiagnosed. This suggests that cardiac involvement can be the initial presentation in some cases, and PTPN11 should be considered in the differential diagnosis of HCM. PTPN11 variants associated with NSML are clustered in the phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domain and have been shown to inhibit phosphatase activity. Since null variants have not been associated with the NSML phenotype, it has been suggested that NSML is caused by a dominant-negative effect rather than simple loss of function, possibly due to altered interaction between PTPN11 and binding partners. Allelic disorders include Noonan syndrome, caused by gain-of-function variants in PTPN11, and metachondromatosis, caused by loss-of-function PTPN11 variants.",2025-09-09 09:58:55+00:00,

The disease mechanism is loss of function via haploinsufficiency, dominant negative or both (PMID 32372669; 23137101; 16917092; NBK1131). DSP-related ARVC is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner characterized by incomplete penetrance (PMID: 21636032; 33831308). However, DSP is associated with multiple phenotypes which are heterogeneous and overlapping (including DCM, DCM with cutaneous features, ARVC, and Carvajal syndrome) and autosomal recessive inheritance has been reported. There does not appear to be distinct mechanisms leading to different phenotypes https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/gene-dosage/HGNC:3052. The initial variant description in DSP was in Carvajal syndrome characterized by woolly hair, keratoderma and ARVC. In 2000 three families from Ecuador were found to be homozygous for the variant 7901delG in DSP which produces a premature stop codon leading to a truncated desmoplakin protein missing the C domain of the tail region (PMID 11063735). Since then both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive patterns of inheritance have been described in Carvajal syndrome (PMID: 27761164; 20940358; 22795705; 26604139; 23137101). This was followed by the description of a heterozygous variant in DSP in an Italian family with ARVC with co-segregation of the variant with disease. There have been reports of digenic inheritance with other desmosomal pathogenic variants. In a retrospective multicentre study, curly hair and/or thick skin on the palms or soles (palmoplantar keratoderma) was commonly present in DSP patients (54/98, 55%) but not in PKP2 patients (1/46, 2%) (PMID: 32372669). Maruthappu et al 2019 also describe 38 patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy who were carriers of a dominant loss-of-function (nonsense or frameshift) variants in DSP. Nearly all were found to have curly hair and palmoplantar keratoderma. However, there was one family described where the majority did not demonstrate a curly hair/cutaneous phenotype. The variant in this family was located in a fragment (c.3585-5379, (p.1195-1793)) only included in isoform 1 of DSP (it has previously been shown that isoform 2 is the major isoform regulating keratinocyte adhesion (PMID: 30382575). Both truncating (stop gained, frame shift, splice site) and non-truncating variants in DSP have been reported in the literature associated with ARVC (PMID 31319917; 20716751; 23810894; 24503780; 27532257; 31514951; 27761164; 21636032; 32808748). Pathogenic truncating variants are more common. Grondin et al 2020 re-evaluated reported missense variants and found an enrichment localizing to the spectrin repeat domain (SRD) in cases vs gnomAD.

The disease mechanism is loss of function via haploinsufficiency, dominant negative or both (PMID 32372669; 23137101; 16917092; NBK1131). DSP-related ARVC is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner characterized by incomplete penetrance (PMID: 21636032; 33831308). However, DSP is associated with multiple phenotypes which are heterogeneous and overlapping (including DCM, DCM with cutaneous features, ARVC, and Carvajal syndrome) and autosomal recessive inheritance has been reported. There does not appear to be distinct mechanisms leading to different phenotypes https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/gene-dosage/HGNC:3052. The initial variant description in DSP was in Carvajal syndrome characterized by woolly hair, keratoderma and ARVC. In 2000 three families from Ecuador were found to be homozygous for the variant 7901delG in DSP which produces a premature stop codon leading to a truncated desmoplakin protein missing the C domain of the tail region (PMID 11063735). Since then both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive patterns of inheritance have been described in Carvajal syndrome (PMID: 27761164; 20940358; 22795705; 26604139; 23137101). This was followed by the description of a heterozygous variant in DSP in an Italian family with ARVC with co-segregation of the variant with disease. There have been reports of digenic inheritance with other desmosomal pathogenic variants. In a retrospective multicentre study, curly hair and/or thick skin on the palms or soles (palmoplantar keratoderma) was commonly present in DSP patients (54/98, 55%) but not in PKP2 patients (1/46, 2%) (PMID: 32372669). Maruthappu et al 2019 also describe 38 patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy who were carriers of a dominant loss-of-function (nonsense or frameshift) variants in DSP. Nearly all were found to have curly hair and palmoplantar keratoderma. However, there was one family described where the majority did not demonstrate a curly hair/cutaneous phenotype. The variant in this family was located in a fragment (c.3585-5379, (p.1195-1793)) only included in isoform 1 of DSP (it has previously been shown that isoform 2 is the major isoform regulating keratinocyte adhesion (PMID: 30382575). Both truncating (stop gained, frame shift, splice site) and non-truncating variants in DSP have been reported in the literature associated with ARVC (PMID 31319917; 20716751; 23810894; 24503780; 27532257; 31514951; 27761164; 21636032; 32808748). Pathogenic truncating variants are more common. Grondin et al 2020 re-evaluated reported missense variants and found an enrichment localizing to the spectrin repeat domain (SRD) in cases vs gnomAD. A similar hot spot location (amino acid residues 250-604) was reported by Kapplinger et al in 2011 (PMID: 32808748; 21636032).

PKP2 encodes plakophilin-2 which is a protein of the desmosome and provides structural and functional integrity to adjacent cells. The disease mechanism in ARVC is loss of function (LoF). Rasmussen et al showed that truncating variants in PKP2 resulted in PKP2 transcript and protein levels reduced to approx 50% (PMID: 24704780). Cerrone et al showed that loss of PKP2 in adult myocytes was sufficient to generate an arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy of right ventricle predominance in mice (PMID: 28740174). PKP2 is the major causative gene for ARVC and accounts for 34%-74% of cases (PMID: 20301310). Inheritance is predominantly autosomal dominant characterised by variable expression and incomplete penetrance (PMID: 34120153; 21636032; 17010805). Both recessive and digenic inheritance (with one pathogenic variant in PKP2 and a second in another desmosomal gene) have been reported (including a recessive cryptic splice variant PMID 17041889) and appear to confer a more severe phenotype (PMID: 30830208; 25616645; 24070718; NBK1131). The expert panel noted instances where PKP2 LoF variants on both alleles had resulted in neonatal lethality.

This was originally identified in Newfoundland and has subsequently been found in patients from other countries including USA, Germany, and Denmark (PMID: 33831308; 18313022; 23812740). It is reported that '[the variant occurs on] a common haplotype with those from Newfoundland, USA, and Denmark, suggesting that the mutation originated from a common founder. Examination of 40 control chromosomes revealed an estimated age of 1300-1500 years for the mutation, which proves the European origin of the Newfoundland mutation.' (PMID  24598986)  The disease mechanism is largely unknown.

JUP encodes the protein plakoglobin. Kaplan et al found that in 4 Naxos patients, Connexin43 expression at intercellular junctions was significantly reduced and mutant plakoglobin was expressed but failed to localize normally at intercellular junctions (PMID:15851108). Inheritance is autosomal recessive.  The initial nine patients described ranged in age from 7 to 41 years. Since then, more patients have been discovered carrying the disease with an estimate of 1:1000 in the population of the Greek islands. The disease has also been diagnosed in other countries (PMID: 32966140). A homozygous 2bp deletion in plakoglobin (JUP), c.2157delTG, causing a frameshift and premature termination of the protein and expression of a truncated plakoglobin lacking 56 residues from the C terminus was described in 2000 (PMID:10902626). The truncated protein was identified on western blot.  In 2017, a homozygous missense variant was described in 7 unrelated French-Canadian individuals. All had typical hair and skin findings; 4/7 had ARVC presenting after 28 years (PMID: 28098346). The effect of this variant in the heterozygous state was not investigated. Two siblings of consanguineous parents were found to have a homozygous 3bp deletion in JUP c.901903delGAG (p.Glu301del). Both had woolly hair and skin findings, only the older sister had ARVC and neither had palmoplantar keratoderma (PMID: 28098346). In OMIM there have been reports of other types of homozygous variants (nonsense, splice, missense) in JUP causing overlapping phenotypes and segregating with disease. Data on biallelic LoF variants are sparse.  In mice, generation of a null mutation of the plakoglobin gene by homologous recombination results in embryonic lethality (PMID: 8954745; 8858175). There are 2 reports in humans who had skin features but no obvious cardiomyopathy (PMID: 20130592; 21320868). In one, JUP expression in the skin was absent. Cardiac JUP expression was not directly measured to establish the consequence in the heart therefore it is not known whether variant allele was expressed, degraded, or rescued by alternate splicing. To note dominant pathogenic variants in JUP have also been rarely described in association with ARVC. Asimaki et al reported a dominant variant in JUP in a German family with ARVC and no obvious cutaneous abnormalities (PMID: 17924338). Other studies have identified heterozygous missense variants however their pathogenicity is still debated (PMID 25820315; 20031617; 31402444).",2025-09-05 11:14:04+00:00,

The disease mechanism is loss of function.   To date, SCN5A is the only gene classified as having definitive evidence as a cause of monogenic Brugada syndrome (BrS) by ClinGen (PMID: 29959160). SCN5A pathogenic variants are identified in approx. 20- 30% of cases of European ancestry (PMID: 30139433; PMID 33164571). This contribution may differ in other populations.  SCN5A-related Brugada syndrome is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance (PMID 9521325; 11748104; 25905440; 20031634; 33164571; NBK1517). Hundreds of variants, both truncating and non-truncating, have been described in association with Brugada syndrome. Kapplinger et al 2010 (PMID: 20129283) identified 293 distinct variants in SCN5A: 193 missense, 32 nonsense, 38 frameshift, 21 splice-site, and 9 inframe deletions/insertions. Walsh et al 2020 (PMID: 32893267) found that non truncating variants were highly enriched in European cases in the SCN5A transmembrane regions. More recently, a rare non-coding variant in an SCN5A intronic enhancer region has been identified in 9 patients with Brugada syndrome in Thailand (3.9% of the patient cohort). The variant is highly enriched compared to population matched controls and has been functionally validated. It causes significantly reduced SCN5A expression and a reduction in Nav1.5-mediated sodium current density. Authors describe a severe phenotype associated with this variant, 8/9 (89%) of the patients had experienced a cardiac arrest. The variant is in the RE5 enhancer region, 3-38580380-A-C (GRCh38) (PMID: 39391988). Gain of function variants are associated with Long QT syndrome. Although loss of function appears to be the accepted mechanism in Brugada syndrome the SCN5A genotype/phenotype association is still not completely understood. Uncommonly, a single variant can cause both loss of peak current and gain of late current and can lead to a mixed phenotype of LQTS and BrS (PMID: 29806494).",2025-10-14 12:31:40+00:00,

Recent reports have also associated monoallelic or heterozygous CASQ2 variants with CPVT.  Although the evidence for this association is not definitive, available data suggests that disease is likely due to decreased gene product level or altered gene product sequence. The main evidence for autosomal dominant CASQ2 association comes from an international multi-centre study describing CPVT patients with CASQ2 variants (Ng et al, 2020, PMID:32693635). This study included 12 probands with heterozygous variants in CASQ2, as well as an assessment of heterozygous relatives of probands with homozygous/compound heterozygous CASQ2 variants (8/37 of these heterozygous relatives had a positive CPVT phenotype). While this study provides a substantive body of evidence to support autosomal dominant CASQ2 association with CPVT, the data should be cautiously interpreted. The multi-centre nature of the study precluded standardised phenotyping of the probands and relatives and therefore not every phenotype-positive individual may have a definitive diagnosis of CPVT. Additionally, several of the variants described have a gnomAD population minor allele frequency that is incompatible with being a penetrant autosomal dominant variant for a disease with the prevalence of CPVT (>1x10-5). The variants also included presumed nonsense mediated decay-escaping C-terminal truncating variants and a splice region variant without a proven effect on splicing. In contrast to 97% penetrance for homozygous/compound heterozygous individuals, penetrance for heterozygotes was only 33% although it is expected that the population level penetrance of CASQ2 heterozygous variants will be lower still. Further support for the pathogenicity of heterozygous CASQ2 variants comes from a study that described the heterozygous p.Lys180Arg variant segregating with disease in a family (the published LOD score was 3.0 although there were only five meioses between genotype and phenotype positive individuals) (Gray et al, 2016, PMID:27157848).",2024-03-13 11:49:22+00:00,

The likely disease mechanism is gain of function. Over 200 pathogenic missense variants and inframe deletions or insertions have been reported. The sodium current mediated by Nav1.5 consists of peak and late components (INa-P and INa-L). It is thought that gain-of-function SCN5A pathogenic variants lead to enhanced INa-P and INa-L, which can trigger life-threating arrhythmias.  SCN5A-related LQTS accounts for 5-10% of LQTS cases (PMID:27566755). Rare missense variants are estimated to occur in around 2% of healthy White and 5% of healthy non-White subjects so collectively missense variants are not rare in the healthy population. SCN5A-related LQTS can present with specific features: patients may have marked resting bradycardia, QT interval prolongation more pronounced during slow heart rate (which might explain why arrhythmic events occur more frequently at rest), a first cardiac event that is lethal, and onset after puberty (PMID: 29798782). It has been noted that approximately 10% of genotype positive LQT patients have more than 1 mutation in >=1 gene. Biallelic pathogenic variants or digenic pathogenic variants appear to be generally associated with a more severe phenotype with longer QTc interval and a higher incidence of cardiac events.

Biallelic loss of function variants in TRDN have also been associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). As patients can have overlapping phenotypes, there is a term 'triadin knockout syndrome'. The Triadin Knock Out Syndrome (TKOS) registry had 21 patients in 2019. All were homozygous or compound heterozygous for TRDN variants. The majority were frameshift or nonsense. There were a small number of missense or splice altering variants.

Heterozygous truncating variants in ALPK3 have been found to be enriched in HCM cohorts over population controls. They have been detected in 1.6% of patients with HCM in two separate cohorts (PMID: 34263907). There is also segregation data to support an association between heterozygous truncating variants and HCM (PMID: 33191771; 34263907). Pathogenic heterozygous missense/non-truncating variants have not been reported in association with cardiomyopathy (PMID: 34526680). The phenotype associated with autosomal dominant ALPK3 related HCM appears to be later onset disease in adulthood with a higher prevalence of apical or concentric hypertrophy. Severity was noted to be similar to those with sarcomeric HCM. No extra-cardiac features are reported (PMIDs: 34263907; 34526680).  Age related penetrance was observed in genotype positive family members. Given the effect size is relatively modest compared to other causal variants in this context (Lopes et al found an odds ratio of 16 between cases and controls, PMIDs: 34263907), the penetrance in the population is expected to be very low. Therefore caution is required when interpreting these variants as secondary findings.

Patients display variable phenotypes but often present at birth or early childhood (at least 4 patients have presented in utero) with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) that progressed to a HCM phenotype over time. Extra-cardiac features including musculoskeletal and craniofacial abnormalities are also commonly observed in these cases (PMID: 32480058; PMID: 34263911). Herkert et al 2020 reviewed the variants and phenotype in 19 paediatric patients with biallelic ALPK3 variants (including 9 previously published cases) and identified 11 loss-of-function (LoF) variants (including nonsense, frameshift and intronic variants with predicted severe effect on splicing), seven compound LoF and deleterious missense variants, and one homozygous deleterious missense variant, c.5155G>C, p.(Ala1719Pro) (PMID: 32480058). The clinical manifestations associated with the missense variants were similar to those associated with other damaging ALPK3 variants. To note heterozygous LoF ALPK3 variants have also been reported and are enriched in adults with cardiomyopathy (PMID: 34263907; PMID: 32480058; PMID: 33191771). Haploinsufficiency is the proposed mechanism. Herkert et al found notable differences between the clinical features associated with monoallelic and biallelic ALPK3 cardiomyopathy, including absence or undetected extracardiac phenotypes. 'Whether these differences reflect graded dose-responses to ALPK3 deficits or distinct mechanisms by which monoallelic or biallelic variants cause disease remains unknown.' (PMID: 32480058). There does not appear to be a distinct mechanism between monoallelic and biallelic variants. The disease mechanism is loss of function of ALPK3 likely due to creation of premature stop codons, leading to nonsense-mediated decay or truncated proteins with partial or complete removal of the kinase domain (PMID:26846950; 27106955; 32480058; 21441111). Herkert et al predicted that missense variants could result in a conformational change that affects protein folding or flexibility, protein-protein or protein-DNA interaction, or the activity of the alpha-kinase domain (PMID: 32480058).",2025-07-15 09:50:09+00:00,

GLA pathogenic variants result in mRNA instability and/or severely truncated a-galactosidase A (a-Gal A) enzyme or an enzyme with markedly decreased activity (NBK1292). Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease caused by pathogenic variants in the GLA gene leading to a greatly reduced or absent activity of a-Gal A, responsible for metabolizing glycosphingolipids. This condition is associated with a progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and its deacylated form, globotriaosylsphingosine (lysoGb3), potentially affecting any organ or tissue (PMID: 32640076). Fabry disease is inherited in an X linked manner. Heterozygous females typically have milder symptoms at a later age of onset than males. Rarely, they may be relatively asymptomatic throughout a normal life span or may have symptoms as severe as those observed in males with the classic phenotype (NBK1292).

Pathogenic variants leading to complete loss of function of the gene product are usually associated with classic forms of the disease, whereas variants resulting in amino acid substitutions and residual enzyme activity can present atypically with either symptoms not specific to Fabry's (e.g. cardiomyopathy) or a milder phenotype and later onset. Attempts to correlate genotype with clinical presentation have been largely unsuccessful. (PMID 27560961; 18940466). Experts noted that conduction disease can be the presenting or only feature of disease. The expert consensus on the management of Fabry Disease in 2020 suggested that 'Assessment of plasma lyso-Gb3 should be considered for assessment of disease severity in FD patients or in the diagnostic algorithm for patients with GLA genetic variants of unknown significance.'

Danon disease follows X-linked inheritance, with high penetrance of cardiomyopathy (dilated or hypertrophic) in hemizygous males. Onset is age-related, with an older age of onset in females than in hemizygous males, and males are more likely to have syndromic involvement (including skeletal myopathy and cognitive impairment). In the majority of cases, the mechanism is loss of function due to decreased gene product, as a result of frameshift variants, nonsense variants, splice-site variants, and copy-number variants. Individual pathogenic missense variants have been reported. Some missense variants also cause a reduction in protein level, e.g. due to aberrant splicing, but there are pathogenic missense variants which have been shown to affect protein structure rather than reducing protein expression. A possible transcript-specific mechanism has been suggested, with variants affecting exon 9b reported as causing a primarily skeletal muscle phenotype, with limited cardiac involvement.",2024-03-26 10:36:17+00:00,

PRKAG2 syndrome is a rare, early-onset autosomal dominant inherited disease, characterized by ventricular pre-excitation, supraventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac hypertrophy (PMID: 26729852; 32259713; 32646570). There is a debate about penetrance but there appears to be variable expressivity of the clinical phenotype which may be variant specific (PMID: 32646569; 12015471). PRKAG2 variants have been recognized mainly in the context of patients with non-sarcomeric familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome (PMID: 26729852). The PRKAG2 gene encodes for the 5' Adenosine Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK), specifically for its gamma2 regulatory subunit (PRKAG2). PRKAG2 pathogenic variants are suspected to modify the tri-dimensional structure of AMPK, altering its affinity for AMP and modifying the enzyme activity (PMID: 32259713; 28009297). Nearly all pathogenic variants are missense (PMID: 32259713; 32646569; 12015471; 28009297).  Blair et al. documented a TTA codon insertion in exon 5 in 2001 in a family affected by severe early onset cardiomyopathy and multiple sudden deaths in early adult life (PMID: 11371514). The variant is in a highly conserved region and co-segregated with disease. This has not been reported again on ClinVar.  Lopez-Sainz A et al reported one frameshift and one intronic variant (the rest missense) in their multi-centre retrospective study of 90 PRKAG2 variant carriers in 2020 (PMID: 32646569). However, the significance of truncating variants remains uncertain with insufficient evidence to support loss of function as a mechanism of disease. ClinGen found no evidence to support haploinsufficiency as a mechanism (https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/gene-dosage/HGNC:9386).  Two commonly reported variants are C.905G>A (p.Arg302Gln) and c.1463A>T (p.Asn488Ile).

There is currently no evidence to support haploinsufficiency as a disease mechanism. Inheritance is autosomal dominant, typified by incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. Most pathogenic variants are missense. There are some inframe deletions reported. A frameshift variant has been identified in 3.3% of Egyptian HCM patients.

While variants p.Asp130Gly and p.Phe142Leu have always been reported as associated with the LQTS phenotype, the variant p.Asn98Ser has phenotypic variability, including LQTS, CPVT, idiopathic VF and sudden death. The majority of CALM variants are de novo. Pathogenic variants in the CALM genes have been associated with: presentation in infancy or early childhood (up to 5 years); marked sinus bradycardia or atrioventricular block and QT prolongation; and, predominantly with CALM1 variants, a mild-to-severe neurological impairment, including seizures, development delay, motor and/or cognitive disability. The phenotype most frequently shown by patients with CALM variants is LQTS, but some patients display other phenotypes including CPVT, idiopathic VF and sudden unexplained death. Some variants have been associated with both LQTS and CPVT, however Crotti et al (PMID: 31170290) report that ""despite the relatively small numbers of cases, a significant association (P=0.001) was observed between location of mutation and phenotype (Supplementary material online, Figure S1).

Troponin T is a regulatory protein found in striated muscles that forms a complex with troponin I (TnI) and troponin C (TnC) that, together with tropomyosin (TM), is required for Ca2+ dependent regulation of muscle contraction. The mechanism appears to be dominant negative rather than haploinsufficiency. The majority of pathogenic variants are missense. A functional study of a splice variant associated with HCM concluded that the resulting truncated protein does not function as a 'null protein, but rather as a dominant-negative leading to reduction in the level of calcium activated force production' (PMID: 8958207). Gangadharan et al suggest the primary reason by which TNNT2 variants between residues 92 and 144 cause cardiomyopathy is by changing the affinity of TnT for Tm within the N terminal part of Troponin T (PMID: 28973951). TNNT2 variants account for <5% of HCM cases (NBK1768; 12860912) Inheritance is autosomal dominant characterised by incomplete penetrance (PMID: 32731933). Homozygous TNNT2 variants causing HCM are rare and have been reported to be associated with more severe disease (PMID 30578328; 10965086; 11034944). Piroddi et al investigated a patient with severe, early onset HCM with a homozygous K280N variant. There was no family information available, however the authors demonstrated that it resulted in 100% mutant cTnT with no evidence of haploinsufficiency and suggested this supports the idea of a gene dose-dependent effect of HCM variants on the severity of the phenotype (PMID 30578328). Experts commented that variants seen in TNNT2 in severe/early onset disease were more likely to be de novo in origin. Nearly all pathogenic variants are missense (PMID: 12707239; 22144547; 25611685). However, there are a few reports of inframe deletions, nonsense variants in the final exon which likely escape nonsense mediated decay and splice donor variants (PMID: 8958207; 12707239; 22144547; 25611685). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/43673/;  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/177636/  Walsh et al found non truncating variants in the TNNT2 gene to be significantly enriched in HCM cases, odds ratio 11.4 (8.5 - 15.2).

Pulmonary stenosis is the most common cardiac manifestation. The penetrance of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in PTPN11-related Noonan syndrome has been reported as 20-30%. There is no definite evidence of PTPN11 variants causing isolated cardiac disease without other features of Noonan syndrome, but the syndromic phenotype can be subtle and may be underdiagnosed. This suggests that cardiac involvement can be the initial presentation in some cases, and PTPN11 should be considered in the differential diagnosis of HCM. PTPN11 variants are the most common cause of Noonan syndrome, accounting for approximately 50% of cases. The mechanism is likely gain of function due to missense variants (particularly variants disrupting interaction between the N-SH2 and PTP domains), leading to activation of the RAS-MAPK pathway. There are at least two reports of Noonan syndrome due to single-residue in-frame deletions in PTPN11. There are reports of structural duplications including PTPN11 causing Noonan syndrome, but all patients reported to date have had a relatively non-specific phenotype and large duplications encompassing other genes. It is therefore not clear whether gene duplication specifically causes Noonan syndrome. Allelic disorders include Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML, previously known as LEOPARD syndrome), caused by dominant-negative PTPN11 variants, and metachondromatosis, caused by loss-of-function PTPN11 variants.",2022-05-25 11:23:35+00:00,

The allelic requirement for pathogenicity is monoallelic autosomal, and the disease is typified by incomplete penetrance. Disease is due to an altered gene product sequence.   The first reports of RYR2 variants in CPVT included numerous examples of de novo inheritance (Priori et al, 2001, PMID:11208676; Priori et al, 2002, PMID:12093772), although RYR2 missense variants often occur through familial autosomal dominant inheritance.  The predicted functional consequence of RYR2 pathogenic variants is altered gene product sequence. The majority of causative RYR2 variants in CPVT patients are heterozygous missense variants which are detected in up to 60% of cases with a definitive CPVT diagnosis (Kapplinger et al, 2018, PMID:29453246) and act through a gain-of-function mechanism. Pathogenic variants in CPVT cases tend to be clustered in a number of regions in the RYR2 gene/protein: -  Original exon hotspots: 3-15, 44-50, 83-90 and 93-105 (George et al, 2007, PMID:17081562). -  Updated exon hotspots: 3, 8, 14, 43, 47-49, 81, 83, 88-90, 93, 95, 97-101, 103, 105 (Kapplinger et al, 2018, PMID:29453246). -  Hotspots based on unsupervised clustering algorithm (not restricted to exon boundaries): amino acid residues 2138-2538, 3935-4196 and 4721-4959 (Walsh et al, 2019, PMID:30696458).

The mechanism is likely gain of function (NBK246980; PMIDs: 22610116; 31175705; 30089727). Harakalova et al showed that variants in ABCC9 reduce the ATP-mediated potassium channel inhibition, resulting in channel opening (PMID: 22610116). Pathophysiologic mechanisms resulting in the clinical manifestations remain poorly understood. Cantu syndrome is characterized by congenital hypertrichosis, distinctive facial features, osteochondrodysplasia and cardiac defects. The cardiac manifestations include patent ductus arteriosus, cardiomegaly, hypertrophy and pericardial effusion. Our literature review has not found patients who have presented with isolated left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). All participants with LVH in the Cantu registry who harboured a pathogenic missense variant have at least some additional features in keeping with Cantu syndrome, even if mild. There is however significant variability in phenotype even amongst family members with the same variant (PMID 33529173) and no clear genotype phenotype correlation (PMID 31828977). Inheritance is autosomal dominant characterized by variable expressivity. De novo variants are common, Grange et al found only 16/74 (22%) patients had inherited the ABCC9 variant from an affected parent (PMID: 31828977). It is caused by heterozygous missense mutations in ABCC9 (or less commonly variants in KCNJ8). A review of 74 patients in the International Registry for Cantu syndrome in 2019 found 28 distinct variants (97% were in ABCC9). All were simple missense apart from one insertion deletion involving 2 nucleotides (c.3055_3056 del ins GA). Missense variants were located throughout the protein, however a majority (68%) clustered around transmembrane domain 2 (TMD2). Variants at NM_020297.3(ABCC9): p.Arg1154 (identified in 24 subjects, 33%) and NM_020297.3(ABCC9):p.Arg1116 (identified in 11 subjects, 15%), were most commonly observed (PMID: 31828977). Zhang et al 2021 showed that p.Arg1154Gln variants in genetically modified mice might result in an effective mixed loss/gain of function phenotype, potentially explaining the diverse disease features in patients with CS. The mechanisms resulting in the clinical manifestations of CS remain to be fully elucidated (PMIDs 33529173; 34453476).",2025-09-05 09:41:51+00:00,

A dominant-negative mechanism has been suggested (Selcen et al 2003 PMID:14681890, Wang et al 2001 PMID:11440982). In addition two stop lost variants have been reported (PMIDs:38212463, 33272090). Variants in CRYAB have been associated with systemic features of crystallinopathy (cataract, skeletal myopathy) with and without cardiac involvement. The cardiomyopathy phenotype includes various subtypes. Our literature search did not identify cases presenting with isolated left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Evidence for dosage sensitivity is limited. Homozygous truncating variants predicted to cause NMD have been associated with autosomal recessive congenital/early-onset cataracts and myopathy with respiratory involvement in early childhood, and the heterozygous parents of probands are reported as being healthy.",2025-10-09 15:58:57+00:00,

Two thirds of individuals have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM); diabetes mellitus can also be associated.  Our literature search did not identify cases presenting with isolated left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).  Heterozygous carriers of FXN expansions or other pathogenic variants have not been reported to develop symptoms. Homozygous expansion of the GAA triplet repeat in exon 1 of FXN is responsible for the majority of cases (95-98%). There is an inverse correlation between the size of the expansion and age of onset (particularly the size of the shorter allele). Anticipation is not observed as the disorder follows autosomal recessive inheritance. The remaining cases are due to compound heterozygosity for a GAA expansion and a sequence variant (truncating, splice-site, or missense) or structural variant (single/multi-exon or whole-gene deletion). There is evidence that compound heterozygosity is associated with earlier onset of symptoms than homozygosity for the GAA triplet repeat expansion, but cardiomyopathy is more common in patients with a homozygous GAA triplet repeat expansion. The mechanism is likely loss of function of FXN due to transcriptional silencing (in the case of the GAA triplet repeat), absent/reduced gene product (truncating variants, structural variants), or missense variants causing loss of function.",2025-09-05 11:04:41+00:00,

There is a genotype-phenotype correlation, with biallelic loss of function expected to result in a severe phenotype (infantile-onset Pompe disease), while patients with residual enzymatic activity develop late-onset Pompe disease. Cardiac involvement is a classical feature of infantile-onset Pompe disease, but has also been reported in the late-onset form.

SLC25A4 encodes AAC1 (also known as ANT1), an ADP/ATP carrier isoform expressed at high levels in the skeletal muscle, heart and brain. Loss of function recessive mutations cause a mitochondrial myopathy and cardiomyopathy phenotype that presents in childhood or early adulthood (also known as mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 12). These comments refer to this phenotype category. There are two other distinct phenotype groups: inherited heterozygous missense variants have been associated with an adult-onset autosomal-dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia; and 2 recurrent de novo missense variants have been reported in seven individuals with a characteristic and severe early onset mitochondrial disease (PMIDs: 27693233; 30013777). As far as we are aware SCL25A4 variants do not present with isolated left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). It is suggested that variants in SLC25A4 leading to transporter dysfunction causes insufficient adenine nucleotide availability for dATP synthesis and consequent imbalanced dNTP pools, leading to mtDNA depletion (PMID 27693233; 30013777). A small number of homozygous and compound heterozygous variants have been described including missense, frameshift and splice variants. There are 4 pathogenic submissions on ClinVar.

Multiple missense, nonsense, frameshift variants have been described in association with DCM and there is sufficient evidence for haploinsufficiency as a mechanism (https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/genes/HGNC:939). In contrast, a specific (missense) variant has been associated with myofibrillar myopathy (MFM). Typical presentation is toe walking and clumsiness with progression to cardiomyopathy and restrictive lung disease. The majority of evidence comes from one recurrent missense variant which causes MFM with prominent cardiac involvement. To our knowledge isolated hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopathy without skeletal muscle pathology has not been reported for BAG3 related MFM. In 2013, Olive et al (PMID: 23995273) summarised that only 12 patients with BAG3 related MFM, all carrying the same p.Pro209Leu recurrent de-novo mutation transmitted from a mosaic parent, have been reported to date (PMID: 19085932; 22734908; 21361913; 20605452).

The mechanism appears to be gain-of-function; pathogenic variants cause either tetramer dissociation or monomer denaturation, which both contribute to the formation of amyloid fibrils in tissue (PMID 25604431; NBK1194). Of note, wildtype TTR can also cause an age-related late onset form of amyloidosis where patients almost exclusively present with cardiac involvement. TTR-related hereditary ATTR amyloidosis is characterised by autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance. There are reports of homozygous and compound heterozygous variants. Biallelic variants appear to cause a more severe phenotype (PMID: 28213611; 15185500; 30328212), however one study reported no difference in phenotype between homozygous and heterozygous carriers (PMID: 15930086). TTR-related hereditary ATTR amyloidosis includes the phenotypes ATTR amyloid neuropathy, ATTR cardiac amyloidosis, ATTR leptomeningeal/CNS amyloidosis. Phenotype varies considerably; individuals can present with multi-systemic phenotypes including, polyneuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, cardiomyopathy, gastrointestinal features, autonomic insufficiency, and renal insufficiency. 'The prevalence of HCM and/or RCM in Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis is high but exact percentages have not been accurately defined due the high prevalence of HCM and RCM (~25%) development in senile cardiac amyloidosis, which occurs due to accumulation of wildtype TTR accumulation in the heart with age.' (ClinGen summary) More than 100 different variants have been reported in the Hereditary Amyloidosis Registry (http://www.amyloidosismutations.com). Variants are all missense apart from one inframe deletion of a valine residue in exon 4 (Plasma transthyretin levels in the mutant gene carriers measured by nephelometry were very low) and one 6 nucleotide duplication in exon 3. The duplication was reported to be associated with a particularly aggressive phenotype and although it did not alter the protein secondary or tertiary structure, it decreased the stability of the TTR monomer and tetramer (PMID: 9191784; 29941560). Several variants including TTR-V30M, TTR-T60A, and TTR-V122L are commonly associated with cardiac amyloidosis (PMID: 28739313). There are other genotype phenotype correlations (PMID: 25604431; NBK1194). The ATTR Val122Ile variant (also reported as pVal142Ile) is a risk allele in patient subpopulations of African American descent. The variant in this population has a high prevalence (estimated 3-4%) and patients are at particular risk for developing cardiac-related ATTR. (PMID: 28213611). A systematic review in 2020 evaluating specific therapies for transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis supported the use of tafamidis (a tetramer stabiliser) and noted that other novel therapeutic targets including transthyretin gene silencers are currently under investigation (PMID: 32969287).",2024-03-26 10:43:49+00:00,

They can cause disease through decreased gene product level and altered gene product sequence. ClinGen originally curated ACTN2 for intrinsic cardiomyopathy (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)) but this was re-evaluated and expanded to include other cardiomyopathy types and skeletal muscle phenotypes in December 2024 (PMID 39971408). ClinGen found no difference in the mechanisms underlying these different disease entities and therefore have grouped them together. Individuals can show variable cardiomyopathy phenotypes, arrhythmias and sudden death (PMID: 34526680); the phenotype can vary between individuals in the same family. Pathogenic variants in this gene can give rise to isolated left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The inheritance pattern is autosomal dominant; however there has been a report of a homozygous ACTN2-truncating variant (in the terminal exon) with a recessive mode of inheritance leading to restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) (PMID: 34802252). The skeletal phenotype is also variable and includes distal myopathy and congenital myopathy. As per ClinGen 'The skeletal muscle cases reported in different families carrying ACTN2 variants had homozygous and heterozygous missense variants reported.

Missense, nonsense, frameshift and larger deletions have all been reported in association with cardiomyopathy phenotypes. 4 missense variants have segregation data and 3 have functional data to support pathogenicity. Patients with these variants presented with atypical and diverse phenotypes. In their review, Walsh et al summarise what is known about ACTN2 variants and their role in cardiomyopathy (PMID: 34526680).

According to Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), loss of function variants are constrained in ACTN2. There have been reports of deletions in ACTN2 leading to disease. An exon 3-6 deletion leading to a frameshift was found in two families with left ventricular non compaction (LVNC) and HCM (PMID 32973354) and an exon 8-10 deletion leading to an in frame deletion was found in a family with LVNC and arrhythmias (PMID: 34802252, PMID: 34526680). Truncating variants in ACTN2 have been identified in approximately 1% of patients previously classified as having LVNC. These variants were significantly enriched in individuals with an LVNC classification compared to controls (0.65% vs. 0.01%, p = 1.3E-06) (PMID 33500567). Of note, it is unclear whether these 'LVNC' individuals exhibited both hypertrabeculation and cardiomyopathy or only hypertrabeculation. Overall, rare variants are not enriched for ACTN2 in HCM or DCM cohorts which suggests they are rarely causative of disease so should be interpreted with caution in cardiomyopathy patients (PMID: 27532257, PMID: 31983221).

They can cause disease through decreased gene product level and altered gene product sequence. The mechanism is loss of function. Both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance have been reported. Seven patients with biallelic truncating variants and HCM have been described (PMID: 30012424, PMID: 31919335, PMID:37431535). The pathogenicity of these variants in heterozygous relatives is not known. Separately, heterozygous CSRP3-truncating variants have been described in patients with HCM (PMID: 30681346). Twenty-five unique variants (16 missense, 4 frameshift, 2 nonsense, 2 canonical splice site, and 1 indel) have been reported in humans (PMIDs: 16352453, 18505755, 15781201, 23396983, 26656175, 21425739, 12642359, 19035361, 25351510, 23861362, 20087448, 30012424, 34558151, 33035702, 31919335, 33012304, 37431535). A meta-analysis found a significant excess of rare variants in cases compared with general population controls (0.9% versus 0.3%) (PMID: 28082330). There is segregation evidence for the missense variant NM_003476.5(CSRP3) c.172T>G (p.Cys58Gly) (PMID: 18505755).

They can cause disease through decreased gene product level and altered gene product sequence. The mechanism is loss of function. Both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance have been reported. Seven patients with biallelic truncating variants and HCM have been described (PMID: 30012424, PMID: 31919335, PMID:37431535). The pathogenicity of these variants in heterozygous relatives is not known. Separately, heterozygous CSRP3-truncating variants have been described in patients with HCM (PMID: 30681346). Twenty-five unique variants (16 missense, 4 frameshift, 2 nonsense, 2 canonical splice site, and 1 indel) have been reported in humans (PMIDs: 16352453, 18505755, 15781201, 23396983, 26656175, 21425739, 12642359, 19035361, 25351510, 23861362, 20087448, 30012424, 34558151, 33035702, 31919335, 33012304, 37431535). A meta-analysis found a significant excess of rare variants in cases compared with general population controls (0.9% versus 0.3%) (PMID: 28082330). There is segregation evidence for the missense variant NM_003476.5(CSRP3) c.172T>G (p.Cys58Gly) (PMID: 18505755).
