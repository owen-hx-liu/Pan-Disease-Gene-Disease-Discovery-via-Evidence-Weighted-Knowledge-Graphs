Most of the mutations have been determined in the transmembrane domains of the cardiac potassium channel genes KCNQ1 and HERG. In this study, we investigated the 3' part of HERG for mutations. METHODS AND RESULTS: New specific primers allowed the amplification of the 3' part of HERG, the identification of 2 missense mutations, S818L and V822 M, in the putative cyclic nucleotide binding domain, and a 1-bp insertion, 3108+1G. Hypokalemia was a triggering factor for torsade de pointes in 2 of the probands of these families. Lastly, in a large family, a maternally inherited G to A transition was found in the splicing donor consensus site of HERG, 2592+1G-A, and a paternally inherited mutation, A341E, was identified in KCNQ1. The 2 more severely affected sisters bore both mutations. CONCLUSIONS: The discovery of mutations in the C-terminal part of HERG emphasizes that this region plays a significant role in cardiac repolarization. Clinical data suggests that these mutations may be less malignant than mutations occurring in the pore region, but they can become clinically significant in cases of hypokalemia. The first description of 2 patients with double heterozygosity associated with a dramatic malignant phenotype implies that genetic analysis of severely affected young patients should include an investigation for >1 mutation  in the LQT genes.";"1999"

Here, a family with severe nonlethal JEB and with mutations in genes for both proteins was identified. The index patient was compound heterozygous for the COL17A1 mutations L855X and R1226X and was heterozygous for the LAMB3 mutation R635X. As a consequence, two functionally related proteins were affected. Absence of collagen XVII and attenuated laminin 5 expression resulted in rudimentary hemidesmosome structure and separation of the  epidermis from the basement membrane, with severe skin blistering as the clinical manifestation. In contrast, single heterozygotes carrying either (1) one or the other of the COL17A1 null alleles or (2) a double heterozygote for a COL17A1 and  a LAMB3 null allele did not have a pathological skin phenotype. These observations indicate that the known allelic heterogeneity in JEB is further complicated by interactions between unlinked mutations. They also demonstrate that identification of one mutation in one gene is not sufficient for determination of the genetic basis of JEB in a given family.";"1999"

This is often ascribed to the differential effects of specific mutations on gene/enzyme function; however, such genotype/phenotype correlations  are usually imprecise. In addition, in some patients with clinical and biochemical findings consistent with a defect in a particular metabolic pathway,  it is ultimately impossible to arrive at a precise enzymatic diagnosis. In this situation, we have increasingly been identifying concurrent partial defects in more than one pathway, or at multiple steps in one pathway. In this study, we present the clinical, biochemical, and molecular findings from several patients showing multiple partial defects in energy metabolism. These patients show clinical symptoms consistent with a defect in the affected pathways even though they do not have a complete deficiency in any one enzyme. We hypothesize that such patients are exhibiting clinically significant reductions in energy metabolism related to the compound effects of these partial defects, a phenomenon we term ""synergistic heterozygosity.""

Fibrinogen levels in functional assays were considerably lower than levels in immunologic assays. Polymerization of purified fibrinogen was strongly impaired in the presence of calcium or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Two heterozygous structural defects were detected by DNA analysis: Aalpha R16C and gamma G165R. As seen previously with other heterozygous Aalpha R16C variants, thrombin-catalyzed  release of fibrinopeptide A was 50% of normal. Additionally, the release of fibrinopeptide B was delayed. Immunoblotting analysis with antibodies to human serum albumin indicated that albumin is bound to Aalpha 16 C. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis of plasmin digests of fibrinogen Milano XII in the presence of calcium or EDTA showed both normal and novel D1 and D3 fragments. Further digestion of abnormal D3 fragments by chymotrypsin resulted in degradation products of the same size as the fragments derived from normal fibrinogen. SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions showed no difference between normal fibrinogen and fibrinogen Milano XII or between their plasmic fragments. Circular dichroism analysis revealed a shift in  the mean residual ellipticity and a significant reduction of the alpha-helix content in the variant D3 fragment. It is concluded that the Aalpha-chain substitution is mainly responsible for the coagulation abnormalities, whereas the substitution in the gamma-chain induced a conformational change in the D3 fragment.";"2001"

By a combination of single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct cycle sequencing, MYOC mutations were detected in 8 (13.3%) of the 60 individuals, CYP1B1 mutations were detected in 3 (5%) of the 60 individuals, and  no PITX2 mutations were detected. The range of phenotypic expression associated with MYOC and CYP1B1 mutations was greater than expected. MYOC mutations included cases of juvenile glaucoma with or without pigmentary glaucoma and mixed-mechanism glaucoma. CYP1B1 mutations involved cases of juvenile open-angle  glaucoma, as well as cases of congenital glaucoma. The study of a family with autosomal dominant glaucoma showed the segregation of both MYOC and CYP1B1 mutations with disease; however, in this family, the mean age at onset of carriers of the MYOC mutation alone was 51 years (range 48-64 years), whereas carriers of both the MYOC and CYP1B1 mutations had an average age at onset of 27  years (range 23-38 years) (P=.001). This work emphasizes the genetic heterogeneity of juvenile glaucoma and suggests, for the first time, that (1) congenital glaucoma and juvenile glaucoma are allelic variants and (2) the spectrum of expression of MYOC and CYP1B1 mutations is greater than expected.

To investigate the mechanisms by which mutations might cause glomerular protein leak, we analysed NPHS1/NPHS2 genotype/phenotype relationships in 41 non-Finnish  CNF patients, four patients with congenital (onset 0 to 3 months) focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and five patients with possible SRN1 (onset 6 months to 2 years). We clarify the range of NPHS1 mutations in CNF, detecting mutation 'hot-spots' within the NPHS1 coding sequence. In addition, we describe a novel discordant CNF phenotype characterized by variable clinical severity, apparently  influenced by gender. Moreover, we provide evidence that CNF may be genetically heterogeneous by detection of NPHS2 mutations in some CNF patients in whom NPHS1  mutations were not found. We confirm an overlap in the NPHS1/NPHS2 mutation spectrum with the characterization of a unique di-genic inheritance of NPHS1 and  NPHS2 mutations, which results in a 'tri-allelic' hit and appears to modify the phenotype from CNF to one of congenital focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). This may result from an epistatic gene interaction, and provides a rare example of multiple allelic hits being able to modify an autosomal recessive disease phenotype in humans.

To date, four of the five known BBS loci have been implicated in this mode of oligogenic disease transmission. We present a comprehensive analysis of the spectrum, distribution,  and involvement in non-Mendelian trait transmission of mutant alleles in BBS1, the most common BBS locus. Analyses of 259 independent families segregating a BBS phenotype indicate that BBS1 participates in complex inheritance and that, in different families, mutations in BBS1 can interact genetically with mutations at  each of the other known BBS genes, as well as at unknown loci, to cause the phenotype. Consistent with this model, we identified homozygous M390R alleles, the most frequent BBS1 mutation, in asymptomatic individuals in two families. Moreover, our statistical analyses indicate that the prevalence of the M390R allele in the general population is consistent with an oligogenic rather than a recessive model of disease transmission. The distribution of BBS oligogenic alleles also indicates that all BBS loci might interact genetically with each other, but some genes, especially BBS2 and BBS6, are more likely to participate in triallelic inheritance, suggesting a variable ability of the BBS proteins to interact genetically with each other.";"2003"

At present, causal mutations of LQTS have been identified in five cardiac ion-channel genes. Because a causal mutation is usually unique to a specific family and can be located in any region of any of these five genes, a mutation analysis effort may require screening of the complete coding regions of each of these genes. The causative nature of a detected mutation can then be determined either by family history or by functional studies, such as the electrophysiological signature of the mutation. Here we describe a mutation analysis of an LQTS patient who carries two heterozygous missense mutations in two different LQTS genes. The first mutation identified, A572D in SCN5A, was not linked with clinical LQTS features in the two other mutation carriers in the family; neither was it identified in 90 healthy controls. Therefore, this mutation most likely has either a mild effect on cardiac ion-channel function or represents a very rare polymorphism. The second mutation, V254M in KCNQ1, co-segregated with higher QT intervals and symptoms in  other family members, and was previously reported in another LQTS family. Because the clinical LQTS symptoms are most pronounced in the proband, a combined effect  of both mutations cannot be excluded, although no functional data are available to support such an hypothesis. We conclude that, for newly presented LQTS cases,  a mutation analysis strategy should routinely screen the complete coding region of all LQTS genes, followed by an evaluation of the identified mutation(s) in conjunction with family or functional data.";"2003"

RESULTS: Mutations were identified in 97% of the probands, representing 282 alleles (86.8%). Forty new mutations were identified: 24 in SLC3A1 and 16 in SLC7A9. Type A heterozygotes showed phenotype I, but mutation DupE5-E9 showed phenotype non-I in some heterozygotes. Type B heterozygotes showed phenotype non-I, with the exception of 10 type B mutations which showed phenotype I in some heterozygotes. Thus most type I probands carried type A mutations and all type non-I probands carried type B mutations. Types B and A mutations contributed to mixed type, BB being the most representative genotype. Two mixed cystinuria families transmitted mutations in both genes: double compound heterozygotes (type AB) had greater aminoaciduria than single heterozygotes in their family. CONCLUSIONS: Digenic inheritance is an exception (two of 164 families), with a limited contribution to the aminoaciduria values (partial phenotype) in cystinuria.

In this study we screened 56 unrelated patients with FEVR (31 familial and 25 simplex cases) for possible mutations in LRP5 and FZD4. Six novel mutations in either LRP5 or FZD4 were identified in six familial cases. Four novel mutations in LRP5 and one  known mutation in FZD4 were detected in three simplex cases, and two of these patients carried compound heterozygous mutations in LRP5. Remarkably, c.1330C>T [p.R444C] in LRP5 was found in the family in which c.1250G>A [p.R417Q] in FZD4 had previously been identified. The phenotype of these patients suggested a synergistic effect of the two mutations in the independent FEVR-causing genes.

Here we report the identification of a novel locus, MGC1203, that contributes epistatic alleles to Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a pleiotropic, oligogenic disorder. MGC1203 encodes  a pericentriolar protein that interacts and colocalizes with the BBS proteins. Sequencing of two independent BBS cohorts revealed a significant enrichment of a  heterozygous C430T mutation in patients, and a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) showed strong over-transmission of this variant. Further analyses showed that the 430T allele enhances the use of a cryptic splice acceptor site, causing  the introduction of a premature termination codon (PTC) and the reduction of steady-state MGC1203 messenger RNA levels. Finally, recapitulation of the human genotypes in zebrafish shows that modest suppression of mgc1203 exerts an epistatic effect on the developmental phenotype of BBS morphants. Our data demonstrate how the combined use of biochemical, genetic and in vivo tools can facilitate the dissection of epistatic phenomena, and enhance our appreciation of the genetic basis of phenotypic variability.";"2006"

However, a greater than expected increase in ALA, compared with PBG, and a substantial increase in erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin, suggested additional ALA dehydratase (ALAD) deficiency. Nucleotide sequence analysis of coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPO) cDNA of the patient, but not of the parents, revealed a novel nucleotide transition G835-->C, resulting in an amino acid change, G279R. The mutant CPO protein expressed in Escherichia coli was unstable, and produced about 5% of activity compared with the wild-type CPO. Erythrocyte ALAD activity was 32% of normal in the proband. Nucleotide sequence analysis of cloned ALAD cDNAs from  the patient revealed a C36-->G base transition (F12L amino acid change). The F12L ALAD mutation, which was found in the mother and a brother, was previously described, and is known to lack any enzyme activity.

Epub 2006 Apr 3.";"Individuals with the same genetic disorder often show remarkable differences in clinical severity, a finding generally attributed to the genetic background. We identified two patients with genetically proven Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) who followed an unusual course and had uncommon clinicopathological findings. We hypothesized digenic inheritance and looked for additional molecular explanations. Mutations in additional separate genes were identified in both patients. The first patient was a member of a family with molecularly proven X-linked EDMD. However, the clinical features were unusually severe for this condition in the propositus: he presented at 2.5 years with severe proximal weakness and markedly elevated serum creatine kinase. Muscle weakness rapidly progressed, leading to loss of independent ambulation by the age of 12. In addition, the patient developed cardiac conduction system disease requiring pacing at the age of 11 and severe dilated cardiomyopathy in the early teens. Despite pacing, he had several syncopal episodes attributed to ventricular dysrhythmias. As these resemble the cardiac features of patients with the autosomal dominant variant of EDMD, we examined the lamin A/C gene, identifying a de-novo mutation in the propositus. The second patient had a cardioskeletal myopathy, similar to his mother who had died more than 20 years previously. Because of the dominant family history, a laminopathy was suspected and a mutation in exon 11 of the LMNA gene was identified. This mutation, however, was  not present in his mother, but instead, surprisingly, was identified in his virtually asymptomatic father. Unusual accumulations of desmin found in the cardiac muscle of the propositus prompted us to examine the desmin gene in this patient, and in so doing, we identified a desmin mutation, in addition to the LMNA mutation in the propositus. These cases suggest that separate mutations in related proteins that are believed to interact, or that represent different parts of a presumed functional pathway, may synergistically contribute to disease severity in autosomal dominant EDMD. Furthermore, digenic inheritance may well contribute to the clinical severity of many other neuromuscular disorders.";"2006"

One of the reasons for this variability in expression could be the coexistence of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on LQTS-causing genes and/or unknown genes.

LQTS, which affects approximately 1 in 3000 persons, is 1 of the most common causes of autopsy-negative sudden death in the young. Since the sentinel discovery of cardiac channel gene mutations in LQTS in 1995, hundreds of mutations in 8 LQTS susceptibility genes have been identified. All 8 LQTS genotypes represent primary cardiac channel defects (ie, ion channelopathy) except LQT4, which is a functional channelopathy because of mutations in ankyrin-B. Approximately 25% of  LQTS remains unexplained pathogenetically. We have pursued a ""final common pathway"" hypothesis to elicit novel LQTS-susceptibility genes. With the recent observation that the LQT3-associated, SCN5A-encoded cardiac sodium channel localizes in caveolae, which are known membrane microdomains whose major component in the striated muscle is caveolin-3, we hypothesized that mutations in caveolin-3 may represent a novel pathogenetic mechanism for LQTS. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using polymerase chain reaction, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, and direct DNA sequencing, we performed open reading frame/splice site mutational analysis on CAV3 in 905 unrelated patients referred  for LQTS genetic testing. CAV3 mutations were engineered by site-directed mutagenesis and the molecular phenotype determined by transient heterologous expression into cell lines that stably express the cardiac sodium channel hNa(v)1.5. We identified 4 novel mutations in CAV3-encoded caveolin-3 that were absent in >1000 control alleles. Electrophysiological analysis of sodium current  in HEK293 cells stably expressing hNa(v)1.5 and transiently transfected with wild-type and mutant caveolin-3 demonstrated that mutant caveolin-3 results in a  2- to 3-fold increase in late sodium current compared with wild-type caveolin-3.  Our observations are similar to the increased late sodium current associated with LQT3-associated SCN5A mutations. CONCLUSIONS: The present study reports the first CAV3 mutations in subjects with  LQTS, and we provide functional data demonstrating a gain-of-function increase in late sodium current.";"2006"

To date, several single-gene defects have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IHH. However, significant inter- and intrafamilial variability and apparent incomplete penetrance in familial cases of IHH are difficult to reconcile with the model of a single-gene defect. We therefore hypothesized that mutations at different IHH loci interact in some families to modify their phenotypes. To address this issue, we studied 2 families, one with Kallmann syndrome (IHH and anosmia) and another with normosmic IHH, in which a single-gene defect had been identified: a heterozygous FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) mutation in pedigree 1 and a compound heterozygous gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GNRHR) mutation in pedigree 2, both of which varied markedly in expressivity within and across families. Further candidate gene screening revealed a second heterozygous deletion in the nasal embryonic LHRH factor (NELF) gene in pedigree 1 and an additional heterozygous FGFR1 mutation in pedigree 2 that accounted for the considerable phenotypic variability. Therefore, 2 different gene defects can synergize to produce a more  severe phenotype in IHH families than either alone.

METHODS: Fourteen members of a single family underwent neurologic, electromyographic, and cardiologic assessment. Gene mutation and protein expression analyses were performed for lamins A/C and emerin. RESULTS: Clinical investigations showed various phenotypes, including isolated cardiac disease (seven patients), axonal neuropathy (one patient), and a combination of EDMD with axonal neuropathy (two patients), whereas five subjects  remained asymptomatic. Genetic analyses identified the coincidence of a previously described homozygous LMNA mutation (c.892C-->T, p. R298C) and a new in-frame EMD deletion (c.110-112delAGA, p. delK37), which segregate independently. Analyses of the contribution of these mutations showed 1) the EMD  codon deletion acts in X-linked dominant fashion and was sufficient to induce the cardiac disease, 2) the combination of both the hemizygous EMD and the homozygous LMNA mutations was necessary to induce the EDMD phenotype, 3) emerin was present  in reduced amount in EMD-mutated cells, and 4) lamin A/C and emerin expression was most dramatically affected in the doubly mutated fibroblasts.

Here, we report a family with PXE-like cutaneous features in association with multiple coagulation factor deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder associated with GGCX mutations. The proband and her sister, both with severe skin findings with extensive mineralization, were compound heterozygotes for missense mutations in the GGCX gene, which were shown to result in reduced gamma-glutamyl carboxylase activity and in undercarboxylation of matrix gla protein. The proband's mother and aunt, also manifesting with PXE-like skin changes, were heterozygous carriers of a missense mutation (p.V255M) in GGCX and a null mutation (p.R1141X) in the ABCC6 gene, suggesting digenic nature of their skin findings. Thus, reduced gamma-glutamyl carboxylase activity in individuals either compound heterozygous for a missense mutation in GGCX or with haploinsufficiency in GGCX in combination with heterozygosity for ABCC6 gene expression results in aberrant mineralization  of skin leading to PXE-like phenotype. These findings expand the molecular basis  of PXE-like phenotypes, and suggest a role for multiple genetic factors in pathologic tissue mineralization in general.";"2009"

We have excluded the possibility that mutations in exon 1 of  GJB2 and the deletion of GJB6 are the second mutant allele in these Chinese heterozygous probands. Two different GJB3 mutations (N166S and A194T) occurring in compound heterozygosity with the 235delC and 299delAT of GJB2 were identified  in three unrelated families (235delC/N166S, 235delC/A194T and 299delAT/A194T). Neither of these mutations in Cx31 was detected in DNA from 200 unrelated Chinese controls. Direct physical interaction of Cx26 with Cx31 is supported by data showing that Cx26 and Cx31 have overlapping expression patterns in the cochlea. In addition, by coimmunoprecipitation of mouse cochlear membrane proteins, we identified the presence of heteromeric Cx26/Cx31 connexons. Furthermore, by cotransfection of mCherry-tagged Cx26 and GFP-tagged Cx31 in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells, we demonstrated that the two connexins were able to co-assemble in vitro in the same junction plaque.

That a sizable fraction of patients carry only one SLC26A4 mutation suggests that EVA/PS is a complex disease involving other genetic factors.

DESIGN AND PATIENTS: We studied clinical and endocrine features that reflect the  functioning of the pituitary-gonadal axis, and the nonreproductive phenotype, in  55 adult KS patients (42 men and 13 women), of whom 41 had monoallelic mutations  and 14 biallelic mutations in PROK2 or PROKR2. RESULTS: Biallelic mutations were associated with more frequent cryptorchidism (70% vs. 34%, P < 0.05) and microphallus (90% vs. 28%, P < 0.001) and lower mean  testicular volume (1.2 +/- 0.4 vs. 4.5 +/- 6.0 ml; P < 0.01) in male patients.

Here, we have determined that mutations in PDZ domain-containing 7 (PDZD7), which encodes a homolog of proteins mutated in Usher syndrome subtype 1C (USH1C) and USH2D, contribute to Usher syndrome. Mutations in PDZD7 were identified only in patients with mutations in other known Usher genes. In a set of sisters, each with a homozygous mutation in USH2A, a frame-shift mutation in PDZD7 was present in the sister with more severe RP and earlier disease onset. Further, heterozygous PDZD7 mutations were present in patients with truncating mutations in USH2A, G protein-coupled receptor 98 (GPR98; also known as USH2C), and an unidentified locus. We validated the human genotypes using zebrafish, and our findings were consistent with digenic inheritance of PDZD7 and GPR98, and with PDZD7 as a retinal disease modifier in patients with USH2A. Pdzd7 knockdown produced an Usher-like phenotype in zebrafish, exacerbated retinal cell death in combination with ush2a or gpr98, and reduced Gpr98 localization in the region of the photoreceptor connecting cilium. Our data challenge the view of Usher syndrome as a traditional Mendelian disorder and support the reclassification of Usher syndrome as an oligogenic disease.";"2010"

BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS5, BBS7, BBS8, and BBS9 form a complex called the BBSome, which is believed to recruit Rab8(GTP) to the primary cilium and promote ciliogenesis. The second group, the chaperonin-like proteins BBS6, BBS10, and BBS12, have been defined as a vertebrate-specific branch of the type II chaperonin superfamily. These may play a role in the regulation of BBSome assembly. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using sequence analysis, the role of BBS6, 10 and 12 was assessed in the patient population comprising 93 cases from 74 families. Systemic and ocular phenotypes were defined. In the study, chaperonin-like BBS gene mutations accounted for the disease in approximately 36.5% of BBS families. A total of 38 different non-polymorphic exonic sequence variants were identified in 40.5% of BBS families (41.9% cases), of which 26 were novel (68%). Six cases had  mutations present in more than one chaperonin-like BBS gene. One case with four mutations in BBS10 had a phenotype of overall greater severity. The phenotypes observed were beyond the classic BBS phenotype as they overlapped with characteristics of MKKS (congenital heart defect, vaginal atresia, hydrometrocolpos, cryptorchidism), as well as Alström syndrome (diabetes, hearing loss, liver abnormalities, endocrine anomalies, cardiomyopathy). CONCLUSIONS: While overlap between the MKKS and BBS phenotypes has previously been reported for cases with BBS6 mutations, we also observed MKKS phenotypes involving BBS10 and BBS12 and Alström-like phenotypes associated with mutations in BBS1, BBS2, BBS6, BBS7, BBS9, BBS10 and BBS12 for the first time.";"2010"

RESULTS: Eighty-eight percent had undergone pubarche, 51% had spontaneous thelarche, and 10% had 1-2 menses. Women with spontaneous thelarche were more likely to demonstrate normal pubarche (P = 0.04). In 27% of women, neuroendocrine studies demonstrated evidence of some endogenous GnRH secretory activity.

This is the first report of such digenic inheritance. By analyzing cognate targets of each gene, we showed that FOXC1 and  PITX2 can independently regulate their own and each other's target gene promoters and do not show synergistic action in vitro. Mutation in either gene caused reduced transcriptional activation to different extents on the FOXO1 and PLOD1 promoters, whereas both mutations in combination showed the lowest level of activation.

Here we mapped a new locus for Joubert syndrome (JBTS), which we have designated as JBTS15, and identified causative mutations in CEP41, which encodes a 41-kDa centrosomal protein. We show that CEP41 is localized to the basal body and primary cilia, and regulates ciliary entry of TTLL6, an evolutionarily conserved polyglutamylase enzyme. Depletion of CEP41 causes ciliopathy-related phenotypes in zebrafish and mice and results in glutamylation defects in the ciliary axoneme.

Such abnormal mitochondria have been reported in cases with autosomal dominant MFN2 mutations and in one patient with an autosomal recessive GDAP1 mutation. Our two cases show that heterozygous truncation of MFN2, which is silent at least until the sixth decade, when combined with the mild p.R120W GDAP1 variant, leads to a severe neuropathy.

To track the genetic ancestry of PROKR2 L173R, haplotype mapping was performed in 22 unrelated patients with GnRH deficiency carrying L173R and their 30 first-degree relatives. The mutation's age was estimated using a haplotype-decay model. Thirteen subjects were informative and in all of them the mutation was present on the same ~123 kb haplotype whose population frequency is ≤10%. Thus, PROKR2 L173R represents a founder mutation whose age is estimated  at approximately 9000 years. Inheritance of PROKR2 L173R-associated GnRH deficiency was complex with highly variable penetrance among carriers, influenced by additional mutations in the other PROKR2 allele (recessive inheritance) or another gene (digenicity). The paradoxical identification of an ancient founder mutation that impairs reproduction has intriguing implications for the inheritance mechanisms of PROKR2 L173R-associated GnRH deficiency and for the relevant processes of evolutionary selection, including potential selective advantages of mutation carriers in genes affecting reproduction.";"2012"

The mutational spectra of OCA are population-specific. Some OCA patients carry mutations from different OCA genes. In this study, we investigated the frequency of digenic mutations in Chinese OCA patients. METHODS: Genomic DNAs were extracted from the blood samples of 184 clinically diagnosed OCA patients and 120 unaffected subjects. The amplified DNA segments of the exons and exon-intron boundaries were screened for mutations of TYR, OCA2, TYRP1, SLC45A2, and HPS1 by direct sequencing. To exclude the previously unidentified alleles from polymorphisms, samples from 120 unaffected controls were sequenced for the same regions of variations. RESULTS: In all 184 patients, 134 had two pathologic mutations on one locus. Eleven cases had no apparent pathologic mutations in any of the genes studied. Among the remaining 39 patients who had only one pathologic mutation, five patients (2.7% in total) were found to carry the mutational alleles on a second locus in TYR, OCA2 or SLC45A2. Of the five digenic OCA patients, four patients were clinically diagnosed as OCA2 and one patient as OCA1. A previous unidentified allele p.G188D in SLC45A2 was identified, which was not present in the 120 unaffected controls. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of the digenic OCA patients suggests the synergistic roles among TYR, OCA2 and SLC45A2 during melanin biosynthesis, which  may cause OCA under digenic mutations. This information will be useful for gene diagnosis and genetic counseling of OCA in China.";"2013"

The proband was diagnosed with diabetes at 7 yr of age and treated with insulin for 4 yr. Her genetic diagnosis resulted in transition to sulfonylureas for one and a half years before insulin therapy was re-initiated due to declining glycemic control.

Among the >15 genes implicated in these conditions, mutations in FGF8 and FGFR1 account for ~12% of cases; notably, KAL1 and HS6ST1 are also involved in FGFR1 signaling and can be mutated in CHH. We therefore hypothesized that mutations in genes encoding a broader range of modulators of the FGFR1 pathway might contribute to the genetics of CHH as causal or modifier mutations. Thus, we aimed to (1) investigate whether CHH individuals harbor mutations in members of the so-called ""FGF8 synexpression"" group and (2) validate the ability of a bioinformatics algorithm on the basis of  protein-protein interactome data (interactome-based affiliation scoring [IBAS]) to identify high-quality candidate genes. On the basis of sequence homology, expression, and structural and functional data, seven genes were selected and sequenced in 386 unrelated CHH individuals and 155 controls. Except for FGF18 and SPRY2, all other genes were found to be mutated in CHH individuals: FGF17 (n = 3  individuals), IL17RD (n = 8), DUSP6 (n = 5), SPRY4 (n = 14), and FLRT3 (n = 3). Independently, IBAS predicted FGF17 and IL17RD as the two top candidates in the entire proteome on the basis of a statistical test of their protein-protein interaction patterns to proteins known to be altered in CHH. Most of the FGF17 and IL17RD mutations altered protein function in vitro. IL17RD mutations were found only in KS individuals and were strongly linked to hearing loss (6/8 individuals). Mutations in genes encoding components of the FGF pathway are associated with complex modes of CHH inheritance and act primarily as contributors to an oligogenic genetic architecture underlying CHH.";"2013"

METHODS: We performed whole-exome sequencing in a patient with ataxia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, followed by targeted sequencing of candidate genes in similarly affected patients. Neurologic and reproductive endocrine phenotypes  were characterized in detail. The effects of sequence variants and the presence of an epistatic interaction were tested in a zebrafish model. RESULTS: Digenic homozygous mutations in RNF216 and OTUD4, which encode a ubiquitin E3 ligase and a deubiquitinase, respectively, were found in three affected siblings in a consanguineous family. Additional screening identified compound heterozygous truncating mutations in RNF216 in an unrelated patient and  single heterozygous deleterious mutations in four other patients. Knockdown of rnf216 or otud4 in zebrafish embryos induced defects in the eye, optic tectum, and cerebellum; combinatorial suppression of both genes exacerbated these phenotypes, which were rescued by nonmutant, but not mutant, human RNF216 or OTUD4 messenger RNA. All patients had progressive ataxia and dementia. Neuronal loss was observed in cerebellar pathways and the hippocampus; surviving hippocampal neurons contained ubiquitin-immunoreactive intranuclear inclusions. Defects were detected at the hypothalamic and pituitary levels of the reproductive endocrine axis. CONCLUSIONS: The syndrome of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, ataxia, and dementia  can be caused by inactivating mutations in RNF216 or by the combination of mutations in RNF216 and OTUD4. These findings link disordered ubiquitination to neurodegeneration and reproductive dysfunction and highlight the power of whole-exome sequencing in combination with functional studies to unveil genetic interactions that cause disease.

Therefore, we hypothesized that EDA mutations interact with WNT10A mutations to play a role in tooth agenesis.

Targeted exon sequencing of selected genes using the massively parallel DNA sequencing technology will potentially enable us to systematically tackle previously intractable monogenic disorders and improve molecular diagnosis.

Herein, we report the molecular findings regarding the analysis of PROK2, in two brothers with nCHH.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS:

Two siblings with nCHH, in whom mutations in GNRHR, PROKR2 and FGFR1 had been investigated previously, as well as their family were studied. DNA was amplified by PCR and sequenced for the PROK2 gene. Controls were analyzed by restriction fragment-length polymorphism. The structure of PROK2 and its mutant protein were compared using a protein molecular model.
RESULTS:

Both affected siblings exhibited a heterozygous p.R117W mutation in PROK2, while their mother was a heterozygous carrier and their father, an unaffected brother and their sister were homozygous wild type. Besides, both patients presented a homozygous p.E90K mutation in GNRHR that had been previously reported.

The wide phenotypic variability and the presence of incomplete penetrance suggest that a simple Mendelian model cannot completely explain the genetic control of this disease. Therefore, we explored the possibility that Alport syndrome is under digenic control.
METHODS:Using massively parallel sequencing, we identified 11 patients who had pathogenic mutations in two collagen IV genes. For each proband, we ascertained the presence of the same mutations in up to 12 members of the extended family for a total of 56 persons studied.
RESULTS:Overall, 23 mutations were found. Individuals with two pathogenic mutations in different genes had a mean age of renal function deterioration intermediate with respect to the autosomal-dominant form and the autosomal-recessive one, in line with molecule stoichiometry of the disruption of the type IV collagen triple helix.
CONCLUSIONS:Segregation analysis indicated three possible digenic segregation models: (i) autosomal inheritance with mutations on different chromosomes, resembling recessive inheritance (five families); (ii) autosomal inheritance with mutations on the same chromosome resembling dominant inheritance (two families) and (iii) unlinked autosomal and X-linked inheritance having a peculiar segregation (four families). This pedigree analysis provides evidence for digenic inheritance of Alport syndrome. Clinical geneticists and nephrologists should be aware of this possibility in order to more accurately assess inheritance probabilities, predict prognosis and identify other family members at risk.";"2015"

We applied whole-exome sequencing to all 11 probands. We used a filtering strategy assuming  that de novo variants of known autosomal dominant (AD) deafness genes, biallelic  mutations in autosomal recessive (AR) genes, monoallelic mutations in X chromosome genes for males, and digenic inheritance could be associated. Candidate variants first were prioritized with allele frequency in public databases and confirmed by a phase or a segregation test in each family. Additional information from the literature or public databases was used to identify strong candidate variants.Results:Strong candidate variants were detected in 5 of 11 probands (45.4%). A diverse mode of inheritance implicated the sporadic occurrence of the phenotype. AR mutations in OTOGL and SERPINB6 and  digenic inheritance involving two deafness genes, GPR98 and PDZ7, were detected.  A de novo AD mutation also was detected in TECTA and MYH14. No syndromic feature  was detected in individuals with GPR98/PDZ7 or MYH14 variants in our cohort at this moment.Conclusion:Mild to moderate pediatric SNHL, even if sporadic, features a strong genetic etiology and can manifest via diverse modes of inheritance.

Five desmosomal genes (PKP2, DSG2, DSP, DSC2 and JUP) were sequenced directly from genomic DNA. Among the 36 patients, 21 mutations, 12 of which novel, were discovered in 19 individuals (19 of 36, 53%).  The distribution of the mutations was 25% in PKP2, 14% in DSP, 11% in DSG2, 6% in JUP, and 3% in DSC2. Multiple mutations were identified in 2 subjects (2 of 36, 6%); both had digenic heterozygosity. Eight mutations, of which six were novel, were located in highly conserved regions. Seven mutations introduced a stop codon prematurely, which would result in premature termination of the protein synthesis. Two-dimensional echocardiography showed that LDVd and LDVs parameters  were significantly larger in nonsense mutation carriers than in carriers of other mutations. In this comprehensive desmosome genetic analysis, 21 mutations were identified in five desmosomal genes in a group of 48 local Han Chinese subjects with ARVC, 12 of which were novel.

We describe a new PAM in a patient with proximal muscle weakness and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, whose muscle fibres contained inclusions containing myosin and myosin-associated proteins, and aberrant distribution of microtubules. These lesions appear as intact A- and M-bands lacking thin filaments and Z-discs. These features differ from inclusions in myosin storage myopathy (MSM), but are highly similar to those in mice deficient for the muscle-specific RING finger proteins MuRF1 and MuRF3. Sanger sequencing excluded mutations in the MSM-associated gene MYH7 but identified mutations in TRIM63 and TRIM54, encoding MuRF1 and MuRF3, respectively. No mutations in other potentially disease-causing genes were identified by Sanger and whole exome sequencing. Analysis of seven family members revealed that both mutations segregated in the family but only the homozygous TRIM63 null mutation in combination with the heterozygous TRIM54 mutation found in the proband caused the disease phenotype. Both MuRFs are microtubule-associated proteins localizing to sarcomeric M-bands and Z-discs. They are E3 ubiquitin ligases that play a role in degradation of sarcomeric proteins, stabilization of microtubules and myogenesis. Lack of ubiquitin and the 20S proteasome subunit in the inclusions found in the patient suggested impaired turnover of thick filament proteins. Disruption of microtubules in cultured myotubes was rescued by transient expression of wild-type MuRF1. The unique features of this novel myopathy point to defects in homeostasis of A-band proteins in combination with instability of microtubules as cause of the disease.";"2015"

Isoform 3 of the plasma membrane Ca(2+) ATPase (the PMCA3 pump), which is highly expressed in brain and cerebellum, plays an important role in the regulation of neuronal Ca(2+). A genetic defect of the PMCA3 pump has been described in one family with X-linked congenital cerebellar ataxia. Here we describe a novel mutation in the ATP2B3 gene in a patient with global developmental delay, generalized hypotonia and cerebellar ataxia. The mutation (a R482H replacement) impairs the Ca(2+) ejection function of the pump.  It reduces the ability of the pump expressed in model cells to control Ca(2+) transients generated by cell stimulation and impairs its Ca(2+) extrusion function under conditions of low resting cytosolic Ca(2+) as well. In silico analysis of the structural effect of the mutation suggests a reduced stabilization of the portion of the pump surrounding the mutated residue in the Ca(2+)-bound state. The patient also carries two missense mutations in LAMA1, encoding laminin subunit 1α. On the basis of the family pedigree of the patient,  the presence of both PMCA3 and laminin subunit 1α mutations appears to be necessary for the development of the disease. Considering the observed defect in  cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and the previous finding that PMCAs act as digenic modulators in Ca(2+)-linked pathologies, the PMCA3 dysfunction along with LAMA1 mutations could act synergistically to cause the neurological phenotype.";"2015"

A primary objective of the present study was to assess the performance characteristics of a 46-gene next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay that targets well-established cardiomyopathy genes. A total of 25 samples were analyzed. Twelve of those had previously been sequenced using resequencing arrays and served as reference samples for the assessment of the assay's performance characteristics. The remaining 13 samples were derived from consecutive patients. Both the analytical  sensitivity and the specificity of the assay were 100% and the percentage of low-coverage bases was 0.4%, at an average read depth of 210×. In order to assess the diagnostic yield of the test, 13 consecutive samples representing cases of Dilated (n = 7), Hypertrophic (n = 4) and Left Ventricular Non-Compaction Cardiomyopathy (n = 2), were subjected to the 46-gene NGS assay. Including predicted pathogenic variants in the gene TTN, a total of 22 variants (11 novel)  were detected in 10 patients, with a clear preponderance of variants of unknown pathogenicity (class 3 variants, 21/22, 95%). Of the seven DCM cases, two were digenic, involving variants in the genes MYH7 and RBM20 in one case and in DSP and TTN in the other case. Three other patients carried single TTN variants predicted to be pathogenic. Of the four HCM patients, one was trigenic (LAMA4, PKP2 and TTN) and three were digenic (DSP and TTN, MYH7 and NEXN, NEXN and TTN, respectively). As to LVNC, one of the two patients had one variant in the gene ABCC9 and two predicted pathogenic variants in the gene TTN. Strikingly, out of the thirteen investigated cases, only a single case exhibited a likely pathogenic or pathogenic variant justifying a positive test report. The percentage of inconclusive cases thus amounted to 69%. Three cases were devoid of any relevant  variant. Two of these ""negative"" cases were subsequently taken to initially evaluate the use of an alternative NGS assay addressing 4813 genes previously implicated in genetic diseases (the so-called clinical exome). Although showing similar sensitivity and specificity values, the coverage of the 46 established cardiomyopathy genes was less efficient (low-coverage bases: 5%). In a case of DCM, the assay revealed a disruptive variant in the gene encoding the adrenoreceptor beta 2 (ADRB2), a protein implicated in signal transduction and energy metabolism in the heart. In conclusion, the 46 gene assay is applicable to routine genetic diagnostics of cardiomyopathy. The test detects many variants of  unknown pathogenicity which need to be followed-up in order to gain benefit for the patients and their families. Samples devoid of any relevant variant may be subjected to a clinical exome assay, in order to identify interesting novel candidate genes.";"2015"

To explore this hypothesis, we undertook whole exome sequencing and targeted high-throughput sequencing approaches to identify mutations in HPE subjects. Here, we report two HPE families in which two mutations are implicated in the disease.

The second reported case is a family with a 9-year-old girl presenting lobar HPE, harbouring two compound heterozygous mutations in DISP1. Together, these cases of digenic inheritance and autosomal recessive HPE suggest that in some families, several genetic events are necessary to cause HPE.

Syndromic RP is accompanied by other symptoms such as intellectual disability, hearing loss, or congenital abnormalities. Both forms are known to exhibit complex genetic interactions that can modulate the penetrance and expressivity of the phenotype.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:In an individual with atypical RP, hearing loss, ataxia and cerebellar atrophy, whole exome sequencing was performed. The candidate pathogenic variants were tested by developing an in vivo zebrafish model and assaying for retinal and cerebellar integrity.
RESULTS:Exome sequencing revealed a complex heterozygous protein-truncating mutation in RP1L1, p.[(Lys111Glnfs*27; Gln2373*)], and a heterozygous nonsense mutation in C2orf71, p.(Ser512*). Mutations in both genes have previously been implicated in autosomal recessive non-syndromic RP, raising the possibility of a digenic model in this family. Functional testing in a zebrafish model for two key phenotypes of the affected person showed that the combinatorial suppression of rp1l1 and c2orf71l induced discrete pathology in terms of reduction of eye size with concomitant loss of rhodopsin in the photoreceptors, and disorganization of the cerebellum.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the combination of heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in these genes drives syndromic retinal dystrophy, likely through the genetic interaction of at least two loci. Haploinsufficiency at each of these loci is insufficient to induce overt pathology.";"2016"

Mutations in SEC23A are responsible for craniolenticosultura dysplasia (CLSD). CLSD patients are short, have late-closing fontanels, and have reduced procollagen (pro-COL1A1) secretion because of abnormal pro-COL1A1 retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The mutation we identified in MAN1B1 was previously associated with reduced MAN1B1 protein and congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). CDG patients are also short, are obese, and have abnormal glycan remodeling.

RESULTS:At least one rare protein-altering gene variant was identified in 19 patients, including missense mutations in new candidate genes, namely SMC1β and REC8 (involved in the cohesin complex) and LHX8, a gene encoding a transcription factor. Novel or recurrent deleterious mutations were also detected in the known POI candidate genes NOBOX, FOXL2, SOHLH1, FIGLA, GDF9, BMP15, and GALT. Seven patients harbor mutations in two loci, and this digenicity seems to influence the age of symptom onset.
CONCLUSIONS:Genetic anomalies in women with POI are more frequent than previously believed. Digenic findings in several cases suggest that POI is not a purely monogenic disorder and points to a role of digenicity. The genotype-phenotype correlations in some kindreds suggest that a synergistic effect of several mutations may underlie the POI phenotype.";"2016"

Although males with XLAS usually develop end-stage renal disease before 30 years of age, some men show a milder phenotype and possess somatic mosaic variants of the type IV collagen α5 gene (COL4A5), with severity depending on variant frequencies. In females, somatic mosaic variants are rarely reported in XLAS, and it is not clear what determines severity.
METHODS:Two females with somatic mosaic mutations in COL4A5 with variant frequencies of 17.9 and 22.1% were detected using the next-generation sequencing. One patient only had hematuria. The other, however, had moderate proteinuria, which is a severe phenotype for a female XLAS patient of her age. The molecular mechanisms for the severe phenotype were investigated by examining variant frequencies in urinary sediment cells and X chromosome inactivation patterns, and by looking for modifier variants in podocyte-related genes using the next-generation sequencing.
RESULTS:The severe phenotype patient had a variant frequency of 36.6% in urinary sediment cells, which is not markedly high, nor did she show skewed X chromosome inactivation. However, she did have the heterozygous variant in COL4A3, which can affect severity.
CONCLUSION:Factors determining severity in female XLAS patients remain unclear. One studied patient with the somatic variant in COL4A5 showed a severe phenotype without skewed X chromosome inactivation, which might be derived from digenic variants in COL4A3 and COL4A5. Further studies are required to determine molecular mechanisms behind female XLAS resulting in the severe phenotype.";"2016"

Here we present a new series of families with DI and we discuss the consequences for genetic counseling and risk assessment. Out of five families harboring variants in more than one COL4 gene detected by next generation sequencing (NGS), minigene-splicing assay allowed us to identify four as true digenic. Two families showed COL4A3/A4 mutations in cis, mimicking an autosomal dominant inheritance with a more severe phenotype and one showed COL4A3/A4 mutations in trans, mimicking an autosomal recessive inheritance with a less severe phenotype. In a fourth family, a de novo mutation (COL4A5) combined with an inherited mutation (COL4A3) triggered a more severe phenotype. A fifth family, predicted digenic on the basis of silico tools, rather showed monogenic X-linked inheritance due to a hypomorphic mutation, in accordance with a milder phenotype. In conclusion, this study highlights the impact of DI in ATS and explains the associated atypical presentations. More complex inheritance should be therefore considered when reviewing prognosis and recurrence risks. On the other side, these findings emphasize the importance to accompany NGS with splicing assays in order to avoid erroneous identification of at risk members.";"2017"

In a considerable number of patients with typical FMF, only one MEFV mutation was identified and the possibility that more than one autoinflammatory gene may be responsible for their disease was investigated. In the present study, an extensive search for possible mutations in three hereditary recurrent fever (HRF) genes was performed in 128 MEFV heterozygous Greek-Cypriots clinically diagnosed based on their phenotype with FMF-like disease from a previous study. Sequence analysis was performed for MVK, TNFRSF1A and NLRP3 genes which is also known to cause HRFs. In total, three patients were identified with heterozygous mutations and a second mutation in an autoinflammatory gene. Two patients carried a MEFV mutation and a NLRP3 mutation, and an additional third carried a MEFV mutation and a TNFRSF1A mutation. Patient 1 carried MEFV p.[Val726Ala] (NM_000243.2:c.2177T>C) and NLRP3 p.[Val198Met] (NM_001243133.1:c.592G>A) variants and patient 2 carried MEFV p.[Glu148Gln] (NM_000243.2:c.442G>C) variant which is of uncertain significance and NLRP3 p.[Arg176Trp] (NM_001243133.1:c.526C>T). Lastly, patient 3 was identified to carry MEFV p.[Met694Val] (NM_000243.2:c.2080A>G) and TNFRSF1A p.[Arg121Gln] (NM_001065.3:c.362G>A) variants. The results from this study indicate that screening of genes known to cause HRFs in patients already identified with a single MEFV mutation, can reveal quite rare but potentially causative mutational combinations at different loci. Such interaction provide further evidence for possible locus-locus interactions and phenotypes resulting from digenic inheritance.";"2016"

Complex genetic patterns of inheritance of this disorder are increasingly recognized.
Objective:The objective of this study was to identify a genetic etiology of PSIS in an affected child.
Methods:Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed using standard techniques, with prioritized genetic variants confirmed via Sanger sequencing. To investigate the effects of one candidate variant on mutant WDR11 function, Western blotting and co-immunofluorescence were used to assess binding capacity, and Leptomycin B exposure along with immunofluorescence were used to assess nuclear localization.
Results:We report a child who presented in infancy with combined pituitary hormone deficiencies whose brain imaging demonstrated a small anterior pituitary, ectopic posterior pituitary, and a thin, interrupted stalk. WES demonstrated heterozygous missense mutations in two genes required for pituitary development, a known loss-of-function mutation in PROKR2 (c.253C>T;p.R85C) inherited from an unaffected mother, and a WDR11 (c.1306A>G;p.I436V) mutation inherited from an unaffected father. Mutant WDR11 loses its capacity to bind to its functional partner, EMX1 and to localize to the nucleus.
Conclusions:WES in a child with PSIS and his unaffected family implicates a digenic mechanism of inheritance. In cases of hypopituitarism where there is incomplete segregation of a monogenic genotype with the phenotype, the possibility that a second genetic locus is involved should be considered.";"2017"

Recently, rare heterozygous alleles in the angiopoietin receptor-encoding gene TEK were implicated in PCG. We undertook this study to ascertain the second mutant allele in a large cohort (n = 337) of autosomal recessive PCG cases that carried heterozygous TEK mutations. Our investigations revealed 12 rare heterozygous missense mutations in TEK by targeted sequencing. Interestingly, four of these TEK mutations (p.E103D, p.I148T, p.Q214P, and p.G743A) co-occurred with three heterozygous mutations in another major PCG gene CYP1B1 (p.A115P, p.E229K, and p.R368H) in five families. The parents of these probands harbored either of the heterozygous TEK or CYP1B1 alleles and were asymptomatic, indicating a potential digenic mode of inheritance. Furthermore, we ascertained the interactions of TEK and CYP1B1 by co-transfection and pull-down assays in HEK293 cells. Ligand responsiveness of the wild-type and mutant TEK proteins was assessed in HUVECs using immunofluorescence analysis. We observed that recombinant TEK and CYP1B1 proteins interact with each other, while the disease-associated allelic combinations of TEK (p.E103D)::CYP1B1 (p.A115P), TEK (p.Q214P)::CYP1B1 (p.E229K), and TEK (p.I148T)::CYP1B1 (p.R368H) exhibit perturbed interaction. The mutations also diminished the ability of TEK to respond to ligand stimulation, indicating perturbed TEK signaling. Overall, our data suggest that interaction of TEK and CYP1B1 contributes to PCG pathogenesis and argue that TEK-CYP1B1 may perform overlapping as well as distinct functions in manifesting the disease etiology.";"2017"

Three families were identified with mutations in the unlinked photoreceptor-specific genes ROM1 and peripherin/RDS, in which only double heterozygotes develop retinitis pigmentosa (RP). These findings indicate that the allelic and nonallelic heterogeneity known to be a feature of monogenic RP is complicated further by interactions between unlinked mutations causing digenic RP. Recognition of the inheritance pattern exemplified by these three families might  facilitate the identification of other examples of digenic inheritance in human disease.";"1994"

HSCR may be inherited as a single gene disorder with reduced penetrance or as a multigenic trait. HSCR mutations have been identified in the RET receptor tyrosine kinase, endothelin-B receptor (EDNRB) and its physiological ligand, endothelin 3 (EDN3). Although RET's ligand has remained elusive, it is expected to be an extracellular neurotrophic molecule expressed in the developing gut and  kidney mesenchyme, based on the phenotypes of intestinal aganglionosis and renal  agenesis observed in homozygous RET knockout (Ret -/-) mice. The glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is such a molecule. Recently, mice carrying two null alleles for Gdnf were shown to exhibit phenotypes remarkably similar to Ret-/- animals. We screened 106 unrelated HSCR patients for mutations  in GDNF by direct sequencing. We identified one familial mutation in a HSCR patient with a known de novo RET mutation and malrotation of the gut. No haplotype sharing was evident in any of 36 HSCR kindreds typed for microsatellite markers surrounding GDNF on human chromosome 5p. Our data suggest that GDNF is a  minor contributor to human HSCR susceptibility and that loss of its function in enteric neurogenesis may be compensated for by other neurotrophic factors or via  other pathways. However, it may be that in rare instances, RET and GDNF mutations act in concert to produce an enteric phenotype.";"1996"

It is characterized by deafness in association with pigmentary anomalies and various defects of neural crest-derived tissues. At least four types are recognized (WS1, WS2, WS3 and WS4) on the basis of clinical and genetic criteria. Two previously described families  seemed to delineate a new subtype characterized by WS2 in conjunction with ocular albinism (OA). Since mutations in the MITF gene are responsible for some instances of WS2, we screened for mutations in one of the WS2-OA families and discovered a 1 bp deletion in exon 8 of MITF. OA previously has been associated with compound heterozygosity for a mutant TYR allele and the TYR(R402Q) allele, a functionally significant polymorphism that is associated with moderately reduced  tyrosinase catalytic activity. In this family, all of the individuals with the OA phenotype are either homozygous or heterozygous for TYR(R402Q), and heterozyous for the 1 bp deletion in MITF This suggests that the WS2-OA phenotype may result  from digenic interaction between a gene for a transcription factor (MITF) and a gene that it regulates (TYR).";"1997"
